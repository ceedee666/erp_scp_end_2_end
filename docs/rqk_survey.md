# A SAP CAP Based Survey Application

The first step to develop the RQK application is the implementation of the
survey application for the end users. The applications is developed using the Javascript version of the
[SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/).

The development of the RQK application consists of the following steps:

* Initializing the CAP project
* Developing the database model
* Developing services based on the database model
* Developing the UI

## Prerequisites

Different development environments (cf. <https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools>) can be used to develop
applications in the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model. In this tutorial the SAP Business Application Studio
is used. Therefore, a new dev space for the SAP Business Application Studio needs to be created.
The new dev space should be of type **SAP Cloud Business Application**. In addition to the standard extensions
also the **Workflow Management** extension needs to be activated for this dev space.

Note that in the SAP Cloud Platform trail account there is a limitation regarding the dev spaces:
> You are allowed a maximum number of 2 dev spaces, and only 1 can be run at a time.
